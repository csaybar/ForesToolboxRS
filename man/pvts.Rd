\title{Change detection using the PVts-\eqn{\beta} approach}
\usage{
pvts(x, startm, endm, threshold = 5, img, tr, time = FALSE,
  vf = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector, Matrix, RasterStack, RasterBrick}

\item{startm}{The start of the monitoring time}

\item{endm}{The end of the monitoring time}

\item{threshold}{The default threshold is 5 for photosynthetic vegetation,
while for indices such as NDVI and EVI the threshold is 3.
Please see Tarazona et al. (2018) for more details.}

\item{img}{The image of the position immediately before the monitoring start,
i.e. the "start-1" position (in case "x" is a matrix).}

\item{tr}{The vector of the analysis time range must contain the start time of the
time series, the end time and the frequency of the series. For example:
tr <- c(1990, 2017, 1) (i.e., the time series starts in 1990, ends in 2017 and
has an annual frequency of 1). See \link[stats]{ts} for more details.}

\item{time}{If it is TRUE the plotting will be with time coordinates
(only if the "tr" parameter is within the function).}

\item{vf}{If the monitoring is with Photosynthetic Vegetation series,
then switch to TRUE.}

\section{Note}{

In order to optimise the detections, it is advisable to make a smoothing
through the \link[ForesToolboxRS]{smootH} function before detecting changes. The smoothing will
allow to eliminate outliers that were not eliminated during the masking
of atmospheric artifacts.

# time series between 1990 and 2017
# We will detect changes in 2008 (position 19)

# Change monitoring period 2006-2016. Where 2006 is position 7 and 2016 is position 16

This algorithm will allow to detect disturbances in the forests using
all the available Landsat set. In fact, it can also be run with sensors
such as MODIS.
