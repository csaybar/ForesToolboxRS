\title{Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI)}
\usage{
ndfiSMA(img, procesLevel = "SR")
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{Imagen Landsat TM, ETM+ o OLI. It could be RasterStack or RasterBrick.}

\item{procesLevel}{Processing level. It is possible to obtain the NDFI from images
in surface reflectance (SR) from TM, ETM+ and OLI, or Top of Atmosphere (TOA) values
only for Lansat 8 OLI. The default is SR. In addition, for any processing level,
the image values must be rescaled between
0 and 10000.}
}
\description{
The NDFI it is sensitive to the state of the canopy cover, and
has been successfully applied to monitor forest degradation and deforestation
in Peru and Brazil. This index comes from the endmembers Green Vegetation (GV),
non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), Soil (S) and the reminder is the shade
component.
